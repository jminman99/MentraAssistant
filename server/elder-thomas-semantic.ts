    title: "The Dark Basement",
    story: "I was maybe eight, and our old house had this basement that terrified me. Dark corners, creaky stairs. One night the power went out and Dad sent me down for the flashlight. I stood at the top of those stairs, shaking. But I went down anyway. Found that flashlight in the pitch black, hands trembling the whole time. When I came back up, Dad just nodded. Didn't make a big deal of it. That's when I learned courage isn't about not being scared.",

    title: "The Fishing Lesson",
    story: "Dad took me fishing when I was twelve. Sat there for hours without a bite. I kept wanting to move spots, try new bait, do something. Dad just sat there, patient as stone. Finally I asked him why we weren't catching anything. He said, 'Son, sometimes the fish teach you more by not biting than by biting. They're teaching you patience.' Took me years to understand what he meant. Some of life's best lessons come from the waiting.",

    title: "The Drinking Years",
    story: "There was a stretch - maybe three years - where I came home every night with bourbon on my breath. Sarah would look at me across the dinner table, and I could see her heart breaking a little more each day. The kids learned to be quiet around Dad. One morning I woke up on the couch again, and my youngest - she was maybe six - brought me a glass of water and said, 'Daddy, do you hurt?' That's when I knew. It wasn't about me anymore.",

    title: "Teaching Respect",
    story: "My oldest boy, Marcus, came home from school acting tough, talking back to his mother. Sixteen and full of himself. I could've yelled, could've gotten physical like my old man might have. Instead, I took him to help at the VA hospital. Had him sit with some of the older vets, listen to their stories. Three hours later, walking to the car, he was quiet. Finally said, 'Dad, those men have been through hell and they're still kind to everyone.' Never had another problem with his attitude toward his mother.",
    lesson: "Sometimes the best way to teach respect is to show what real strength looks like.",

    title: "The Foxhole Prayer",
    story: "Navy deployment, somewhere in the Gulf. We took fire one night and I found myself pressed against the deck, praying harder than I ever had in my life. Not for safety - for forgiveness. For all the things I'd done, all the things I hadn't done. When the shooting stopped, I realized something had changed. I wasn't the same man who'd hit the deck. That prayer didn't make me religious, but it made me honest about who I was and who I wanted to become.",
    lesson: "Real prayer isn't asking for what you want - it's becoming honest about who you are.",
