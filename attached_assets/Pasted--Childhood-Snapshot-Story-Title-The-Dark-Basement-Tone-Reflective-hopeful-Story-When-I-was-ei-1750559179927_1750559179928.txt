🧒 Childhood Snapshot

Story Title: The Dark Basement
Tone: Reflective, hopeful
Story:
When I was eight, my chore was fetching canned peaches from our coal-dusty basement. Every step down those creaky wooden stairs felt like my lungs tightened around fear itself.

Story Title: The Penny Jar

Mom kept a jar of pennies on the fridge and gave us one for every kind word we said to a sibling. By August the jar was half full; by Thanksgiving, nearly empty again after a rough school year. She never scolded—just set the jar back on the counter and said, “Start fresh.”
Lesson: Mercy resets the scoreboard when we fail.

Story Title: The Dishwasher Treaty

💼 Career Journey
